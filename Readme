# Mystery Library Puzzle

## Project Overview
This is a text-based adventure game where players navigate a magical library represented as a linked list network. Each "book" is a node with puzzles to solve. The goal is to travel from one of four entrance books to the final mysterious book by solving riddles and choosing paths.

**Key Features:**
- Dynamic library generated randomly each playthrough.
- Branching paths: EASY books offer 2 choices; HARD books have 1 path.
- Puzzle-based progression.
- Implemented using linked lists with nodes and pointers.

**Book Types:**
- **ENTRANCE (4 books):** Starting points; player chooses one; each has 1 puzzle.
- **INTERMEDIATE (10-15 books):** Randomly EASY (2 paths) or HARD (1 path); distributed and connected.
- **FINAL (1 book):** Ultimate challenge; all paths converge here.

## How the Library is Generated
The Library class (from Member 2) creates:
- 4 entrance nodes, each linked to intermediates.
- 10-15 intermediate nodes, randomly assigned as EASY or HARD.
- Connections ensure no dead ends, balanced branches, and all paths lead to the final node.
- Puzzles are loaded from puzzles.txt and shuffled for variety.
- Random seeding ensures unique playthroughs.
